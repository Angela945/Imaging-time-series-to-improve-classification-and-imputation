"Encoding Time Series as Images for Visual Inspection and Classification Using Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks." 
In Workshops at the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2015.

The scripts are written in Python with the dependencies:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplolib
Cpickle

Anaconda is highly recommended since it seals all the dependency quite well.

serie2GAF.py
Encoding time series to GADF/GASF. 
The parameters are:

datafiles = ['Coffee_ALL'] # Data fine name
trains = [28] # Number of training instances (because we assume training and test data are mixed in one file)
size = [64]  # PAA size
GAF_type = 'GASF' # GAF type: GASF, GADF
save_PAA = True # Save the GAF with or without dimension reduction by PAA: True, False
rescale_type = 'Zero' # Rescale the data into [0,1] or [-1,1]: Zero, Minusone 


serie2MTF.py
Encoding time series to MTF.
The parameters are:

datafiles = ['Coffee_ALL'] # Data fine name
trains = [28] # Number of training instances (because we assume training and test data are mixed in one file)
size = [64]  # PAA size
quantile = [16] # Quantile size
reduction_type = 'patch' # Reduce the image size using: full, patch, paa

The output will be an example grach (of the kth instance) of the polar coordnate images, generated GASF/GADF/MTF images and the pkl file.

If you find the script is helpful, you are highly appreciated if you can cite the above two papers.
